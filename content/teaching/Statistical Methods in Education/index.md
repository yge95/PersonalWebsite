### Course Description

This three-hour course covers basic descriptive and inferential statistics, including measures of central tendency and dispersion. Hypothesis testing related to one-sample z-and t-test; independent and dependent samples t-test; correlation; and chi-square and simple regression are included. An introduction SPSS is required. Offered fall, spring, and summer semesters.

This course introduces students to the discipline of statistics as a science of understanding and analyzing data. Throughout the semester, students will learn how to effectively make use of data in the face of uncertainty: how to collect data, how to analyze data, and how to use data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena.


### Course Objectives
After successfully completing this class, students shall be able to:
- Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods,and determine how they affect the scope of inference.

- Use statistical software to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis.

- Have a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference.

- Apply estimation and testing methods to analyze single variables or the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions.

- Model numerical response variables using a single or multiple explanatory variables.

- Interpret results correctly, effectively, and in context without relying on statistical jargon.

- Critique data-based claims and evaluate data-based decisions.
