### Course Description

The purpose of this course is to provide students with an introduction to survey research methodology in the social and behavioral sciences.

The term “survey research” has a variety of meanings. For example, many achievement tests are described as “surveys” (for example, see the PISA assessments), as are single-question polls on social media platforms, customer satisfaction assessments, and carefully constructed scales designed to assess respondents’ locations on psychological constructs.

In this course, we will focus on the development, revision, and analysis of surveys that are designed to measure psychological constructs from a psychometric perspective. We will briefly consider issues related to large-scale international surveys such as PISA, NAEP, and TIMSS, but these will not be the focus of the course and course content will not cover the analytic strategies that are unique to these assessments in depth (e.g., weighting and plausible values).

The course content, activities, and assignments have been constructed to equip students to be informed in their development, interpretation, and use of survey research methodologies. Students will learn best practices for survey research tasks such as procedures for item writing and revising items, selecting appropriate response formats (including the appropriate number of response categories), selecting an appropriate sample for a survey study, and dealing with missing data. 
The major assignment for this course requires students to develop a research proposal centered around a scale designed to assess a psychological construct of interest to them. Students will complete smaller cumulative assignments that naturally lead to the development of this proposal. Students will also complete smaller lab assignments and reading response assignments related to course topics. 

Although there are qualitative approaches to survey research (e.g., interview-based surveys), these methodologies will not be covered in this course. We will focus on quantitative survey research methodologies.

### Outline of Topics

A detailed course schedule is provided at the end of this document. The major course topics include the following:

•	Introduction to survey research and measurement in the social sciences

•	Introduction to psychological constructs

•	Basic psychometric principles (validity, reliability, and fairness)

•	Item writing for survey research

•	Survey design considerations  

•	Pilot testing for survey research

•	Sampling procedures for survey research

•	Data analysis for survey research

-	Data cleaning

- Descriptive statistics

- Basic item response theory (IRT) model analyses

- Basic rating scale functioning analyses

Given the broad scope of this course, some topics will be given only cursory treatment.
Students are encouraged to reflect on their own learning goals and pursue topics of interest in more depth. The instructor is happy to facilitate such efforts by suggesting additional resources tailored to individual interests.

### Student Learning Outcomes

	Students will: 

•	Be able to discuss measurement in the social sciences in terms of psychological constructs 

•	Understand what empirical research and best practices stemming from this research states about the best way to design scales to measure psychological constructs in the context of survey research 

•	Apply empirical and theoretical understanding of survey design to the revision of an existing survey instrument
•	Be familiar with basic techniques for analyzing survey data based on statistics and psychometrics

•	Apply basic survey analysis techniques to quantitative data collected using surveys

•	Propose a research study that makes use of principles of social science measurement, survey design, and survey data analysis techniques to address a meaningful research question in a social or behavioral science domain
