### Course Description

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to statistical concepts that build upon and extend the concepts presented in BER540/Quantitative I, with an emphasis on a conceptual understanding of statistical ideas, computer-based data analysis, interpretation of results, and written communication of statistical procedures and findings. In order to emphasize the application and interpretation of statistical concepts, the course includes homework and in-class activities that involve computer-based analyses using the SPSS software program and written assignments. The course is divided into four major parts, each of which concludes with a summative Data Analysis and Interpretation project. These projects serve as the major evaluative components of the course.
