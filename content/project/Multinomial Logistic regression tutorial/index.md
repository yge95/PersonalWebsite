title: A Tutorial on Using Bayesian-based Mixed-effects Models for Categorical Outcome Variable 
---

### Abstract

The use of Mixed-effects Modeling has been gaining increasing popularity in the analysis of educational and psychological data with nested multilevel structures when the independence assumption was violated in ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis. However, categorical outcome variables present a challenge to quantitative researchers in terms of estimation and parameter interpretations, especially with the absence of a definitive guide for multinomial logistic regression mixed-effects analysis with categorical data. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how to properly model multilevel multinomial data with random effects in MCMC estimation, and equip researchers with initial Bayesian statistics ability. In specific, this tutorial walks the readers through an unordered multinomial dataset with a particular research design, including a five-level dependent variable, a two-level independent variable, and a grouping variable. These nominal data are fitted with MCMC Generalized Linear Mixed Models and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The visualizations of data (i.e., Q-Q plots, posterior density distributions, and trace plots of iterations) and fixed effects interpretations are provided. We consider our demonstration as an addition to existing quantitative research methodology instructions.
