title: A dual-purpose model for estimating ability and misconceptions
---
Abstract

Misconceptions and alternative conceptions are common in mathematics and science education, where students can hold pre-existing inconsistent views and then generate incorrect understandings regarding concepts, skills, and phenomena. Traditional psychometric approaches usually focus on the estimation of studentsâ€™ ability. To identify misconceptions, the times that students reveal a misconception is usually calculated as an indicator. However, both SICM and GDCM involve complex formulations and their parameters can only be estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. In addition, multiple-choice may not always be the best item format, and researchers and practitioners may prefer questions of other types, such as fill-in-the-blank or short answer items. Therefore, this study focuses on the development of novel models for dichotomously scored items that each associated with some misconceptions.
