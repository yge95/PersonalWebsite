title: Exploring the psychometric properties of a self-efficacy scale for high school students
---
Abstract

In previous studies, researchers have focused on the development and interpretation of measurement tools related to self-efficacy. However, researchers have seldom investigated whether these instruments demonstrate acceptable psychometric properties, including similar item interpretations between subgroups of respondents. The purpose of this study is to explore the extent to which a self-efficacy measure has a consistent interpretation for two self-reported gender subgroups. The researchers utilized Rasch analysis to offer guidance to the design of self-efficacy related surveys and questionnaires. Results suggested gender difference was detected in certain self-efficacy items. Furthermore, suggestions are also provided for instruction and enhancing the self-efficacy for future students.
