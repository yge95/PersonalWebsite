**Identifying Response Styles Using Person Fit Analysis and Response-Styles Models**

### Abstract

In selected-response assessments, respondents often select from rating scale categories to reflect their locations on a construct. Researchers have observed that respondents exhibit response styles, which are systematic patterns of responses in which respondents are more likely to select certain response categories, regardless of their locations on the construct.To identify and minimize construct-irrelevant impacts of response styles, researchers have proposed solutions such as the Partial Credit Model â€“ Response Style (PCMRS; Tutz et al., 2018) as an extension of the Partial credit model (PCM; Masters, 1982) to model the tendency for participants to exhibit response styles. The purpose of this study is to explore the correspondence between person fit analysis and the PCMRS to identify examinees who exhibit centrality and extremism response styles.
