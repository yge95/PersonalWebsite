title: A Multiple Group Joint Modeling of Item Response and Response Times with High-Order Cognitive Diagnostic Modeling to Understand the Effect of Socioeconomic Status Disparities in Students’ Academic Achievement

### Abstract

In recent psychological and educational assessments, computer-based assessments can automatically record multimodal data, such as item responses, response times and clickstream, which could help to gain a more comprehensive understanding of students’ testing performance. Our study proposes joint modeling of latent attributes and response speed using item responses and RTs simultaneously for cognitive diagnosis to better understand students’ academic achievement gaps caused by socioeconomic status. The researchers plan to demonstrate the application of the proposed model through an empirical example using the data acquired from 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) public release dataset. Our study will contribute to future methodology research in the field of educational policy.
