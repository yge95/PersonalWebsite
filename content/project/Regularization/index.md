title: Regularization in Cognitive Diagnosis Models
---

### Abstract

Cognitive diagnostic assessment facilitates the fine-grained measurement of studentsâ€™ mastery/ non-mastery of attributes. Some previous CDMs may be too complicated to be useful, especially when sample size is small and test is short. To achieve parametrically parsimony while preserving appropriate model fit in CDMs, the researchers examine the performance of regularized CDMs with different penalty terms under varied conditions.
