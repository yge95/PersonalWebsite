title: The Impact of Model Size on TargetedStructural Model Fit indices in Structural Equation Modeling
---

---

The purpose of this study is to compare the sensitivity of fit measures to structural misspecification, including Condition 9 and 10 fit indices, RMSEA-p, the method proposed by Hancock that isolates measurement and structural components, and Bayesian fit indices. 
Using the literature review, we can use the model as shown in the figure. The structural misspecification is the direct path from ksi 1 to eta 2. The path is simulated in the population model but it is omitted in the analysis model.
