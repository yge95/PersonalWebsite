title: Sensitivity of Person-Style PCM (PS-PCM) and PCMRS to response styles within subgroups

### Abstract

When differences in response styles, or the tendency to respond in certain scale categories regardless of item content, are related to subgroups, comparisons between groups are compromised. We examined the sensitivity of three extensions of the Partial Credit Model to subgroup-related response styles. All models identified differences in response styles.
