<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Alabama.

I have completed more than two and half years of my coursework. During the process, I have come to a better understanding of the nature of research and have a more sufficient level of software packages such as R, Winsteps, Facets, SAS, and SPSS. Earning a PhD is a first step toward my future goals. I find working in statistics and psychometrics to be intriguing and I would very much like to further my studies to become an expert in this field.
